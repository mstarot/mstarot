        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="p1">I have been reading tarot for over five years and recently started a small business. My goal is to help you feel more confident in your decisions and navigating life.</p>
            <p class="p2">I provide tarot readings on many topics through videos or audio recordings that can be sent either through text or email. Most readings follow a specific spread and are organized into sections: love and relationships, general readings, self-readings, and career and money. I also offer a one-hour maximum recording session of an in-depth general reading or a reading based on your specified topic(s) that you'd like to gain guidance on. These video/voice recordings are sent through a google drive link that will not work after a week unless you save a copy of the file for yourself.</p>
            <p class="p3">If you want a tarot reading but prefer a different format, such as through Instagram, I'm open to that. Please contact me via Instagram or email to discuss your preference before booking a reading.</p>
            <p class="p4">I offer readings that may show potential future outcomes, but that is not the main focus. Keep in mind, these outcomes can change. There are no "bad" messages, just ones you may need to hear. You have the power to shape your own reality and decide what to believe. I use card stock and my intuition to provide insights, but you should never feel constrained by the cards.</p>
            <p class="p5">Please know that I have a no-refund policy, and by booking a reading with me, you agree to this policy.</p>

These readings can focus on romantic relationships, friendships, family bonds, or any type of relationship between you and another person. Book a tarot reading to discover insights about future connections, ways to enhance a current relationship, compatibility with your partner, and much more.</p>
