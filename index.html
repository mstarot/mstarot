        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="p1">Choose the type of reading you’d like, whether that’s a love and relationship reading, a general reading, a self-reflection reading, or a career and money reading.</p>
            <p class="p2">It will send you to a google form which will ask you for your email or your phone number and what you’d like to gain from a reading, questions you have, concerns, etc. It can even be one small question!</p>
            <p class="p3">Once you have submitted the google form, you will receive an email/text within three days providing you with a list of options with different prices. I craft these options with the information you give me. Keep in mind that the more information you’d like to receive from the reading, the more expensive it may be. The first option will always be the cheapest, but I do my best to give you an option that is affordable and covers the highlights of what you desire to gain from the reading. The cheapest possible option would be $10 and will typically only include one card.</p>
            <p class="p4">If you choose not to fill out the portion of the google form asking for what you’d like to gain from the reading, you will still receive a list of reading options related to the type of reading you chose.</p>

            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="p1">I have been reading tarot for over five years and recently started a small business. My goal is to help you feel more confident in your decisions and navigating life.</p>
            <p class="p2">I provide tarot readings on many topics through videos or audio recordings that can be sent either through text or email. Most readings follow a specific spread and are organized into sections: love and relationships, general readings, self-readings, and career and money. I also offer a one-hour maximum recording session of an in-depth general reading or a reading based on your specified topic(s) that you'd like to gain guidance on. These video/voice recordings are sent through a google drive link that will not work after a week unless you save a copy of the file for yourself.</p>
            <p class="p3">If you want a tarot reading but prefer a different format, such as through Instagram, I'm open to that. Please contact me via Instagram or email to discuss your preference before booking a reading.</p>
            <p class="p4">I offer readings that may show potential future outcomes, but that is not the main focus. Keep in mind, these outcomes can change. There are no "bad" messages, just ones you may need to hear. You have the power to shape your own reality and decide what to believe. I use card stock and my intuition to provide insights, but you should never feel constrained by the cards.</p>
            <p class="p5">Please know that I have a no-refund policy, and by booking a reading with me, you agree to this policy.</p>
